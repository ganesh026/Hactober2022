// WAP To Calculate Record-Breaking Days As Per User's Condition.
// Problem Statement:
//             Isyana is given the number of visitors at her local theme park on N consecutive days. 
// The number of visitors on the i-th day is V. A day is record breaking if it satisfies both 
// of the following conditions:

//  1. The number of visitors on the day is strictly larger than the number of 
//     visitors on each of the previous days.
//  2. Either it is the last day, or the number of visitors on the day is strictly 
//     larger than the number of visitors on the following day.

// Note that the very first day could be a record breaking day!
